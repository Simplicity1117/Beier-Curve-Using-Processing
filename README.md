# Beier-Curve-Using-Processing
It's a simple program, that uses processing programming language to compute the Bezier curve on four control points. 
The control points could be selected clciking the screen. X- axis represents along the horizontal and Y-axis represent 
along the Vertical. 

Press p or Esc to exit the program and any key to clear the screen.

There seems to be a small glitch so, it doesn't clear the screen completely,
to completely wipe the screen press any key except p or Esc then, click mouse once and again press any key except the p or Esc. 
This totally clear the screen.

This was a simple work I did during my weeked so, doesn't conatian comments ans so but It does is fun to play with so I thought 
people might like it.
